Got a simple project (maybe a single-page or proof-of-concept), a working knowledge of CSS and no time to waste recreating the same old classes for responsivity? Meet [Matadora](https://github.com/lousousa/matadora).

Matadora is a simple and very minimalistic CSS library for quick, responsive front-end development built by the amazing [Lou Sousa](http://lousousa.com/). Being very clean, you can start using it right now in your project to make it work like a charm on mobile devices without needing to write the very plain old boring media-queries. (Really, why do these need to be so cumbersome?)

Installing it is as simple as installing any package via [Bower](http://bower.io). Simply do `bower install matadora` and you&#8217;re all set!

# How do i use it?

Using Matadora is as simple as it gets. As documented in the [project home page](https://github.com/lousousa/matadora), you simply need to use `.mtd-row` to declare a row somewhere in your document. Then, you are ready to begin using Matadora&#8217;s awesome, super succint syntax to say whether a element should be visible and how much space it should in phones, tablets and desktops. For example, if you wanted an element to take 50% of the screen on laptops and desktops but be 100% wide in smartphone screens, all you have to do is add to it the classes `.lg-050` and `.lg-100`! Check the project page for more examples.

# Is Matadora it production-ready?

Sure it is! We at Bloom have been using it in many websites for some time now, and that includes [our own page](http://bloomestudio.com)! You are free to use it however you want. If you find any problems with the library, or have any suggestions or complaints, make sure to create a issue or a pull request on the project page!

# Why not simply using Bootstrap?

You seriously don&#8217;t need Bootstrap for every damn single website. Really, websites made with Bootstrap almost always look very similar, and not very creative at all. Give Matadora a try now, lets build a better looking and more diverse web!
