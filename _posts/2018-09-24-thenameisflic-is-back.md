# Better later than never.

All of my previous attempts at blogging are online again, since i found a database dump i made before dropping the VPS that hosted the blog. I'm sorry i couldn't restore most images and media, please reach out to me if you would like to see any missing pics fixed.

Soon enough, you'll find here more book reviews, dev blogging and fancy lists.
I hope you like it!
