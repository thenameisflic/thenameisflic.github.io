Hello, dudes and dudettes! Is everything, like, totally bitchin&#8217;? Been on quite an 80s vibe lately! I am currently working on a game that tries to highlight that spirit, [Rainbow Night](http://twitter.com/rainbownighttg). Besides, i just watched Drive, and dude, the movie&#8217;s soundtrack is so rad.

So, as you tell by my [About page](http://thenameisflic.com/about), i&#8217;m not a musician. I&#8217;m not afraid to say i don&#8217;t know nearly enough about notes, scales and stuff to create a song thats likeable, still, i&#8217;ve been practicing. So i went ahead and did what every insane person would do, and created a [SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/ozymas/) to share my humble creations!

I really hope you guys spend a few seconds listening to my tunes, and if you do, please make sure to leave your feedback! Thanks!
